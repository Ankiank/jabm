Main changes since the last release
-----------------------------------

This release is a major refactoring.  The main feature is completely new GUI
which is based on a tabbed window manager provided by InfoNode Docking Windows 
(http://www.infonode.net/index.html?idw).  To run JABM using the GUI there is a 
new main class net.sourceforge.jabm.DesktopSimulationManager.
